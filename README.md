Module 4: School District Analysis

## Overview
Having been given two data sets, one holding school information and one holding student information, the analysis was approached from a variety of angles. After cleaning the data by correcting unwanted prefixes and suffixes that could affect reporting integrity, a basic analysis was run to understand school budgets in relation to score averages and overall passing percentages. This was expanded on by pulling budget per student and compiling with per school averages and passing percentages. Following those analysis we were able to identify the top five and bottom five performing schools. The analysis was finalized by completing analysis to group information by spending ranges and school sizes, this helps present the information in a more meaningful way, that can be considerd for decision making, rather than a simple chart or dataframe presentation that would require some interpretation. Upon review, it was noticed that there was academic dishonesty among nonth graders for Thomas High School, therefore these grades were removed and new analysis rendered.

#### Process
With the initial analysis complete and approved, the adjustments required us to only use the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades scores for analysis.

## Results

The adjustment made to account for the academic dishonesty resulted in slightly lower average math scores and passing percentages in math, reading, and overall. The only area that does not show as being affected is average reading.
